├── INDEX.HTML      # Main webpage
├── admin.html      # Admin dashboard

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A backend server (see VetGuardSolutions backend)
- Modern web browser

### Usage
1. Place the frontend files on a web server or use the backend's `public` folder.
2. Open `INDEX.HTML` in your browser to view the site.
3. Ensure the backend API is running and accessible for full functionality (appointments, newsletter).

### Connecting to Backend
- The frontend uses JavaScript (`SCRIPT.JS`) to send requests to backend API endpoints (e.g., `/api/appointments`, `/api/subscribers`).
- Update API URLs in `SCRIPT.JS` if deploying backend to a remote server.

## Deployment
- Host the frontend on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
- For best results, serve both frontend and backend from the same domain or configure CORS on the backend.
